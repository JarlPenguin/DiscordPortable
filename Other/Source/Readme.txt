If you would like to preserve any directories and/or file(s) during upgrades or reinstalls you can do so by writing in the installer.ini located within the AppInfo directory (..\FLStudioPortable\App\AppInfo). If there isn't an installer.ini file than simply create it within the AppInfo folder and use the example format below.
